I just wanted to say It wasn't until the end of the night that I spiraled beyond my usual playful argument banter with you. I think over reacted when you mentioned things that I felt bad about because I also reacted poorly to those situations. I really felt bad most of all because I want to (embarrassingly) look good in front of you. All of a sudden this fucking (miraculously) changes; the only person I know would free me from myself and (selfishly) allow me be mindful. My brain kicks in. I feel amazing. Pre-writing my own devices for total recall with absolute detail; I want to never forget these fleeting moments I have with you`
